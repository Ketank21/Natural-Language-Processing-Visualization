# Contextual word embedding visualization of word2vec models

## This is my final project of my Data Science bootcamp with Spiced Academy

### https://share.streamlit.io/ketank21/natural-language-processing-visualization/main/src/bg_app.py ###

#### **The main intention of the project are:**
- To understand the working of word2vec models in contextualizing complex text
- develop an interactive user interface with streamlit where users can explore and learn how word2vec models work
- how the models perform when analysing complex text like the Bhagawat Gita
